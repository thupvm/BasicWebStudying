                            The open source Snap.svg library lets anyone create high-resolution SVG images with just a bit of code. This is far easier than learning a program like Illustrator and it lets you animate just like this fun example created by Alexis Blondin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All the letters are created dynamically through JavaScript including the random characters used in the animation. Modern SVG support is huge and these image types can radically change how we build websites in the coming years. This Snap.svg animation is just one example and it’s definitely a cool one.
                        </p>

                            Here’s another fairly common text animation technique which I see all the time. It uses brackets with rotating text almost like a rolodex on the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This animation mimics the typing carousel effect I mentioned earlier, except this can be made with just CSS. It relies on a custom looping animation that moves from one CSS keyframe to another, each frame displaying a different word or phrase in the rotating text.
                        </p>
                        <p>I find this effect much subtler and easier to read on a homepage. If you’re looking for some cool text effects for your homepage this would be an excellent choice.</p>
